# paper-summariser tool!

plan is to create an academic paper summariser and synthesis tool extension to help me with my dissertation reading. woo lit reviews! building as part of the google chrome built-in AI challenge 2025 ðŸ¥¸ 

### current workflow plan
1. user opens an academic paper
2. user clicks the extension icon and presses a button to generate 'summary with key findings' and 'synthesis matrix' (what i have in my table currently name can change)
3. the extension UI displays the structure (summary, critical, gaps, further reading) (loading -> table)
4. user can edit the AI-generated text (relevance and critical appraisal is user led)
5. user can export the matrix (clipboard, csv, markdown)

### chosen technologies
- summarizer API (will summarise the text and extract key info)
- prompt API (will fill in the table)
- rewrite API? (to rewrite the user-led ontent?)
